        <strong><h1 id="blogTitle">Project Ideas and my interests.</h1></strong>
        <p>Hey. My name is Brenden and this is officially my first blog post! In my robotics class, we have to make anything we want for a project.  The only idea I have for a project is making an app. I really like coding and programming things and I have wanted to make an app ever since I started to coding. Other than that, I don't really have any other ideas. Some of my interests are math, coding, and basketball. Later on, I will find out a way to implement some off my interests in an app.</p>
